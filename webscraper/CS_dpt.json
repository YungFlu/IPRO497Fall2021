We will learn how to resolve structural heterogeneity through schema matching and mapping.  The course introduces techniques for querying several heterogeneous datasources at once (data integration) and translating data between databases with different data representations (data exchange).  Furthermore, we will cover the data-warehouse paradigm including the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, the data cube model and its relational representations (such as snowflake and star schema), and efficient processing of analytical queries.  This will be contrasted with Big Data analytics approaches that (besides other differences) significantly reduce the upfront cost of analytics.  When feeding data through complex processing pipelines such as data exchange transformations or ETL workflows, it is easy to lose track of the origin of data. Therefore, in the last part of the course we cover techniques for representing and keeping track of the origin and creation process of data (its provenance).\n\nThe course emphasizespractical skills through a series of homework assignments that help students develop a strong background in data integration systems and techniques.  At the same time, it also addresses the underlying formalisms.  For example, we will discuss the logic based languages used for schema mapping and the dimensional data model as well as their practical application (e.g., developing an ETL workflow with rapid miner and creating a mapping between two example schemata).  The literature reviews will familiarize students with data integration and provenance research.\n\n",

Deep networks can be trained with a single end-to-end model and  bypass the need for traditional task-specific feature engineering. In this way deep learning simplifies learning tasks and allows using developed models to new tasks. Deep networks are suitable for parallel processing implementations and can easily leverage intensive computational resources. The course will focus on mathematical concepts, numerical algorithms, principles, GPU frameworks, and applications of deep learning. Topics include deep feedforward networks, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and deep generative models with applications to data analysis, computer vision, and natural language processing. Several programming assignments and a project will practice the application of deep learning techniques to actual problems. The course requires sufficient math and programming background but does not require prior knowledge in machine learning.\n\n",
