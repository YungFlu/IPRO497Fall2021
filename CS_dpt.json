The introduction of BIM (Building Information Modeling) is an advance in project delivery tools which should be viewed as a multi-dimensional expansion of the mechanisms of management and accommodation of an ever-broadening range of participants in the organization of a project, allowing the development of a new delivery protocol, IBPD (Integrated Building Project Delivery).  BIM is currently recognized as consolidating the basis for a range of functions including drawing, modeling, document management, clash detection, interdisciplinary coordination, estimating, scheduling, constructability review, production modularization, fabrication protocols, and for the analysis of myriad physical and proscriptive demands such as energy consumption, daylighting, code compliance, egress, circulation, and operation scenarios.  The breadth of information embedded in a BIM model will require the emergence of facilitating professionals to an extent previously unknown in the practice and the industry.  This course explores the state of the profession and the anticipated ramifications. Undergraduate students must be in their fifth year of study.\n\n",

Analytical investigation of the techniques and methods of architectural design and representation are interwoven with an analytical investigation of site, place, inhabitation, and elemental spatial archetypes. The studio is largely comprised of two primary projects (Composite City and Inhabited Archetypes), with specific internal phases and deliverables, structured to operate as a complementary whole. Composite City comprises a series of studies in drawing, modeling and making that dissect the layers, components and phenomena of the built environment, via questions of narrative, memory, space, tectonics, systems and compositions. Inhabited Archetypes comprises a series of spatial explorations that employ the preceding analyses as sites of operation. Four archetypes (bridge, tower, wall, stair) prompt fundamental questions of architectural space (tectonics and inhabitation) and design processes. Working iteratively and comparatively, each archetype will be a medium to investigate issues of structure, skin, thickness, thinness, material, assembly, inhabitation and narrative.

Thus the aim of this course is to give students insights into ECM biology and its relevance to modern medicine and biomedical (tissue) engineering. A significant portion of working population is suffering from ECM-related maladies, and the focus of research has shifted into creating ECM implants. The ECM implant market is growing rapidly. For instance, the collagen meniscus implant market was reported to be at $308.6 million in 20181. Understanding the implications of the molecular biology of ECM to feed into this research is highly relevant for students considering careers (academic and industry) in life sciences in industry, academia and healthcare.\nExtracellular Matrix (ECM) is a highly complex system in mammalian biology responsible for structural support and functional (biochemical) signals for physiology. Specific amino acid sequences on the various ECM elements are responsible to trigger intra- and extracellular cascades leading to cell division, proliferation, tissue regeneration, wound healing and inflammation. This course will focus on the following key concepts:\na) Gene expression, structure and function of various ECM proteins and complexes and the physiological processes.\nb) Etiology and the molecular progression of diseases caused by abnormalities to ECM proteins.\nc) Mechanobiology of various ECM proteins.\nd) Structure function and mechanical function of ECM interfaces with other tissues (muscle, bone, skin etc.)\ne) Implications for tissue engineering and development of novel biomimetic and biological ECM implants.\n\n",

Thus the aim of this course is to give students insights into ECM biology and its relevance to modern medicine and biomedical (tissue) engineering. A significant portion of working population is suffering from ECM-related maladies, and the focus of research has shifted into creating ECM implants. The ECM implant market is growing rapidly. For instance, the collagen meniscus implant market was reported to be at $308.6 million in 20181. Understanding the implications of the molecular biology of ECM to feed into this research is highly relevant for students considering careers (academic and industry) in life sciences in industry, academia and healthcare.\nExtracellular Matrix (ECM) is a highly complex system in mammalian biology responsible for structural support and functional (biochemical) signals for physiology. Specific amino acid sequences on the various ECM elements are responsible to trigger intra- and extracellular cascades leading to cell division, proliferation, tissue regeneration, wound healing and inflammation. This course will focus on the following key concepts:\na) Gene expression, structure and function of various ECM proteins and complexes and the physiological processes.\nb) Etiology and the molecular progression of diseases caused by abnormalities to ECM proteins.\nc) Mechanobiology of various ECM proteins.\nd) Structure function and mechanical function of ECM interfaces with other tissues (muscle, bone, skin etc.)\ne) Implications for tissue engineering and development of novel biomimetic and biological ECM implants.\n\n",

Methods include meta-analytic techniques, linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction, traditional \u201cnon-deep\u201d predictive tools (e.g. perceptron, support vector machines, logistic regression, decision trees, boosting,  etc.), and some applications of deep neural networks. Application areas may include medical imaging (e.g. image segmentation), EEG and ECG signal analysis (e.g. anomaly detection), genetics (e.g. imputation methods, polygenic risk score computation, cell-free DNA analysis, etc.). Each course module involves analysis of real data using existing modeling libraries and students\u2019 own implementation. The predictive results may be compared to the state-of-the-art for each example dataset to assess the usefulness of the models. (3-0-3)\n\n",

In the second half of the course, students will learn to analyze energy conservation measures using parametric energy models. The course will also focus on advanced energy modeling topics, such as modeling HVAC systems and controls, passive techniques, composite fenestration, thermal bridges, thermal mass, and others. At the end of the course, students will have two complete energy models that they can use in their portfolio.\n\n",

Furthermore, we will cover the data-warehouse paradigm including the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, the data cube model and its relational representations (such as snowflake and star schema), and efficient processing of analytical queries.  This will be contrasted with Big Data analytics approaches that (besides other differences) significantly reduce the upfront cost of analytics.  When feeding data through complex processing pipelines such as data exchange transformations or ETL workflows, it is easy to lose track of the origin of data. Therefore, in the last part of the course we cover techniques for representing and keeping track of the origin and creation process of data (its provenance).\n\nThe course emphasizespractical skills through a series of homework assignments that help students develop a strong background in data integration systems and techniques.  At the same time, it also addresses the underlying formalisms.  For example, we will discuss the logic based languages used for schema mapping and the dimensional data model as well as their practical application (e.g., developing an ETL workflow with rapid miner and creating a mapping between two example schemata).  The literature reviews will familiarize students with data integration and provenance research.\n\n",

Can film be a force for uncovering and popularizing \"hidden\" histories that upset our assumptions about the past?  This course takes a novel approach to less well-known chapters in history by looking at how films and documentaries can be tools for disseminating historical knowledge and how they can also be activist interventions in how we understand the past and its relationship to the society we live in today.  Throughout the course, we will watch films and documentaries that try to answer the questions posed above, and we will read historical accounts of the events they convey.  Students will learn how to write a short history from primary documents and then transfer it to an audio or a visual medium.  This will result in 2 projects:  a short podcast and a short documentary film on a historical topic.\n\n",

Yet, from the earliest days of computerization, women have played a major role in computing's history.  These stories have often been submerged, and historians have only recently begun to write them back into the main narrative of the history of computing.  Today, this is changing what we think we know about technology's past and how we see our own interactions with it.  In this course, students will look at the history of computing through the eyes of women pioneers -- some famous, some ordinary -- and discuss why we haven't heard very much about this history until now.  The class will help you better understand why gender, sexuality, and race play an important role in where computing has been and where it is going and, even more importantly, how technological change is interdependent with social categories.\n\n",

Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment.  Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the \"four C's.\" Based on their understanding of the \"four C's,\" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix.  These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion).  The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior.  Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework.  This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a \"multiple objective\" perspective:  that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm.  The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project.  There will also be a midterm and final exam.  The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand.

The course will emphasize segmentation of the market, positioning the marketing mix to meet the needs of the market segment, sustaining an 'integrated' marketing mix over the product life cycle, and organizing the 'Strategic Business Unit' to implement the strategy.  In addition to the development of a marketing strategy that 'positions' the product/service to the needs of one or more target markets (segmentation), the execution of a marketing strategy will require a marketing plan that includes the economic and financial analysis of the costs and potential profits of the strategy and an implementation plan including an organizational structure.  This will often be an iterative process to find an optimal combination of costs and pricing and volume to maximize profits.

This course introduces energy markets, discusses trading for speculative, arbitrage, and hedging purposes, and provides a systematic exposition of data-driven analytic models for energy prices and other risk factors. At the end of this semester, students will be able to help research, propose, and implement hedging/trading strategies in energy markets. Beyond reading materials and attending lectures, students will also work on in-class exercises and homework assignments consisting of paper-and-pencil problems and computer programming tasks. Through a term project, students will work on a carefully-designed practical problem, gain hands-on experience of programming for trading and financial risk management, and write a white paper. A white paper in this kind of course serves as an effective marketing tool for job search purposes. The aforementioned in-class exercises and homework assignments will provide various guidance for the term project. The learning objectives of this course is in line with the energy risk professionals (ERP) exam from the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP).

Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment.  Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the \"four C's.\"  Based on their understanding of the \"four C's,\" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix.  These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion).  The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior.  Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework.  This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a \"multiple objective\" perspective:  that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm.  The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project.  There will also be a midterm and final exam.  The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand.

This includes the integration of marketing mix decisions, the longer-term effects of marketing mix decisions, and changes in the mix over time.  For example:  \"Price\" becomes price policy, value-in-use, and price discrimination; \"Product\" becomes product line breadth and variety and product life cycle choices; \"Place\" becomes the design and control of single or multiple channels of distribution; and \"Promotion\" becomes communications, customer loyalty, and brand equity.  The course will emphasize segmentation of the market, positioning the marketing mix to meet the needs of the market segment, sustaining an integrated marketing mix over the product life cycle, and organizing the strategic business unit to implement the strategy.  In addition to the development of a marketing stategy that positions the product/service to the needs of one or more target markets (segmentation), the execution of a marketing strategy will require a marketing plan that includes the economic and financial analysis of the costs and potential profits of the strategy and an implementation plan, including an organizational structure.  This will often be an iterative process to find an optimal combination of costs, pricing, and volume to maximize profits.  This course will use readings, simulations, and cases for about half its content.  The other half of the course will be a team consulting project for an external client.\n\n",

The concepts of both probabilistic and deterministic design are presented, along with the necessary supporting understanding that enables engineers to make design trade-offs that achieve a positive impact on the design process.  Strengthening their ability to contribute in a cross functional environment, students gain insight that helps them understand the reliability engineering implications associated with a given design objective, and the customer's expectations associated with the individual product or product platforms that integrate the design.  These expectations are transformed into metrics against which the design can be measured.

For example, what human proclivity leads to a\nstratified community dominated by a small number of influencers each with a large number\nof followers? How do political attitudes yield social movements, such as mass riots,\nrebellions, and collective altruism? What role do social networks play in influencing\nmarriage age? The discussions are structured around gaining understanding of social\nsystems as complex entities in which autonomous individuals are the elementary unit of\nanalysis. We will then experiment with the bottom-up framework of agent-based modeling\nto gain insight on how macro-patterns\u2014racial segregation, cultural norms, and collective\nactions\u2014arise spontaneously from the interactions of the individuals making up the social\nsystem. Nation-states, cities, and markets are adaptive, self-organizing systems of\nindividuals whose interdependent actions are the fundamental building block of our social\nfabric. Agent-based models (ABMs) are analytically intractable because of the\nheterogeneous nature of gender identities, lifestyles and other demographic characteristics,\nwhich means simulations are the only resort.
