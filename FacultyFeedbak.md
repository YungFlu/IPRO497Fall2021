# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).

## Week 10 ##
- I liked to see code sharing on screen when I joined
- Sprint Lead today: Saurim
- Some week 8 and 9 stories still being worked; let's check velocity next week. Are stories sized right?
- Liked the agreement that everyone is making a solid contribution

## Week 11 ##

 - SCRUM Lead: Abdullah Moizuddin
 - Board looks to be in good shape
 - Good velocity; some good stories were completed this sprint ie DB, API, some front end work
 - Sounds like you are doing a lot of pairing = awesome!
 - Note: JSON file load is problematic (top priority)\
 - Note: customer (student) feedback comments are not sorting chronologically but fix is planned
 - Good demo: I like that each person who completed a story demo'd their work. Let's repeat!
